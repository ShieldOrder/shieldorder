# GitHub Profile: ShieldOrder

## Overview

This profile hosts independent, public infrastructure artifacts focused on governance process clarity and verification hygiene.

The work here does not advocate outcomes, assign authority, or replace human judgment.
It provides portable structure that makes decision processes legible, auditable, and durable across institutional turnover.

## Active Artifacts

### Process Layer Doctrine (PLD)

A mechanism neutral doctrine that defines execution hygiene for governance and grant systems.

PLD focuses on:
- Boundary clarity between governance, execution, custody, and verification
- Artifact based reasoning over narrative claims
- Explicit separation between discretion and verification
- Continuity independent of specific actors or governance mechanisms

Repository:
https://github.com/ShieldOrder/process-layer-doctrine

### Proposal Disclosure Schema (PDS)

An opt in disclosure template for grant applicants and evaluators.

PDS focuses on:
- Making assumptions, constraints, and risks explicit
- Improving proposal legibility without advocacy
- Reducing ambiguity without enforcing behavior
- Supporting clearer evaluation and verification

Repository:
https://github.com/ShieldOrder/proposal-disclosure-schema

## How These Fit Together

PLD addresses how evaluation and oversight are structured.
PDS addresses what information is disclosed into that structure.

They are complementary and independent.
Neither requires adoption of the other.

## Positioning

This work is:
- Independent
- Non authoritative
- Descriptive first
- Institution safe

It is intended to be referenced, adapted, or reused without coordination or permission.

## Status
