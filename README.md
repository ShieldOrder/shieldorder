GitHub Profile

This profile hosts independent, public infrastructure artifacts focused on governance process clarity and verification hygiene.

This work does not advocate outcomes, assign authority, or replace human judgment. It provides portable structure that makes decision processes legible, auditable, and durable across institutional turnover.

## Active artifacts

### Process Layer Doctrine (PLD)
A mechanism-neutral doctrine defining execution hygiene for governance and grant systems.

PLD focuses on:
- Boundary clarity between governance, execution, custody, and verification
- Artifact-based reasoning over narrative claims
- Separation between discretion and verification
- Continuity independent of specific actors or mechanisms

Repository:
https://github.com/ShieldOrder/process-layer-doctrine

### Proposal Disclosure Schema (PDS)
An opt-in disclosure template for grant applicants and evaluators.

PDS focuses on:
- Making assumptions, constraints, and risks explicit
- Improving proposal legibility without advocacy
- Reducing ambiguity without enforcing behavior
- Supporting clearer evaluation and verification

Repository:
https://github.com/ShieldOrder/proposal-disclosure-schema

### Evaluation Surfaces
A taxonomy of decision surfaces, legitimacy signals, and failure modes used in governance arguments.

This repository focuses on:
- Signal fitness by decision surface
- Non-authoritative diagnostic vocabulary for debates
- Separation of preference signaling from correctness and accountability

Repository:
https://github.com/ShieldOrder/evaluation-surfaces

### ZEC Pooled Solvency Feasibility
A research-only feasibility boundary for pooled ZEC solvency proofs under current Zcash constraints.

This repository focuses on:
- ZEC-only, Orchard-only
- No protocol changes assumed
- Deterministic, offline verification profiles
- Explicit stop conditions and failure modes
- Feasibility analysis without product framing

Repository:
https://github.com/ShieldOrder/zec-pooled-solvency-feasibility

## How these fit together
- PLD: evaluation and oversight structure
- PDS: disclosure into that structure
- Evaluation Surfaces: semantics for decision types and legitimacy signals
- ZEC Pooled Solvency Feasibility: feasibility boundary for a specific technical class

These artifacts are complementary and independent. None depends on adoption of the others.
