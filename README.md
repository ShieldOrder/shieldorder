# ShieldOrder

## GitHub Profile

This profile hosts independent, public infrastructure artifacts focused on governance process clarity and verification hygiene.

The work here does not advocate outcomes, assign authority, or replace human judgment. It provides portable structure that makes decision processes legible, auditable, and durable across institutional turnover.

## Active Artifacts

### Process Layer Doctrine (PLD)

A mechanism-neutral doctrine defining execution hygiene for governance and grant systems.

PLD focuses on:
- Boundary clarity between governance, execution, custody, and verification
- Artifact-based reasoning over narrative claims
- Explicit separation between discretion and verification
- Continuity independent of specific actors or governance mechanisms

Repository:  
https://github.com/ShieldOrder/process-layer-doctrine

---

### Proposal Disclosure Schema (PDS)

An opt-in disclosure template for grant applicants and evaluators.

PDS focuses on:
- Making assumptions, constraints, and risks explicit
- Improving proposal legibility without advocacy
- Reducing ambiguity without enforcing behavior
- Supporting clearer evaluation and verification

Repository:  
https://github.com/ShieldOrder/proposal-disclosure-schema

### ZEC Pooled Solvency Feasibility

A research-only feasibility boundary for pooled ZEC solvency proofs under current Zcash constraints.

This repository defines when such systems should *not* be built.

Focus:
- ZEC-only, Orchard-only
- No protocol changes
- Deterministic, offline verification
- Explicit failure and stop conditions
- Feasibility analysis without advocacy

Repository:  
https://github.com/ShieldOrder/zec-pooled-solvency-feasibility

## How These Fit Together

- **PLD** addresses how evaluation and oversight are structured.
- **PDS** addresses what information is disclosed into that structure.
- **ZEC Pooled Solvency Feasibility** defines cryptographic feasibility boundaries for a specific class of systems.

They are complementary and independent. None requires adoption of the others.
